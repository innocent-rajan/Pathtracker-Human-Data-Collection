                    <p><strong> Time required: </strong> Less than 15 minutes.
                    <p><strong> Benefits: </strong> Although there are no direct benefits for the participants in the current study, results may improve our knowledge of the how the brain processes visual objects and scenes.
                    <p><strong> <em> Compensation: You must complete the entire experiment to receive compensation for your participation. </em> </strong>
                    <p><strong> Participant Risks: </strong> There are no anticipated risks for the participants in the current study.
